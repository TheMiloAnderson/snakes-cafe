# Snakes Cafe
**Author**: Milo Anderson
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This application presents a restaurant menu & allows the user to order items from that menu

## Getting Started
Snakes Cafe works with Python 3.6; you can ensure that your environment is using the correct version by using "pipenv shell" from your command line.

## Architecture
The script accepts a name, and displays this with the menu. A while loop checks for 'quit' messages, while accepting order input. Each input is checked against existing menu items before being added to the customer_order dictionary.
